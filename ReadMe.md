## PhP course

This project is meant to teach PhP fundamentals by creating a blog, step by step. It uses the [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/) framework and stores its data in JSON files.

Follow these steps to continuously build a server-side Blog web app with PhP.

1. Create the model classes in the `model` folder.
2. Write scripts in the `scripts` folder that generate test data in JSON format in the `data` folder.
3. Create controllers in the `controllers` folder that load and display the JSON data.
